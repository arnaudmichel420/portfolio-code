              The client has an aging showcase website to promote his sports
              massage service and wants to improve his online presence with a
              more ergonomic, aesthetically pleasing and SEO-optimised website.
              He wanted to develop his clientele so that he could go full-time.
              He also felt that his practice was little known in France, so he
              wanted to promote and explain it better.

          <p>
            For the web design part, I used Figma to quickly sketch and try
            different ideas. For the website, I mainly used WordPress and when
            it wasn't possible to replicate the design or a functionality, I
            used a combination of CSS and JavaScript with ACF to keep the
            content easily changeable by the client.
          </p>

          <h2>Process :</h2>
          <p>
            For the design, I propose different inspirations to the client to
            see what he likes and if it translates to the project goal. From
            there I did a first page and sent him to get his feedback, changed a
            few things and went on to do the rest of the model.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the design was validated, I started to replicate the model on
            WordPress using the best practices for SEO (meta title, h1, li).
            Like I said above when I was limited by CMS or no plugins suited my
            needs. I used custom code to develop the functionality I needed like
            on the booking page it was necessary to control the time range of
            each massage so that the customer doesn't book the wrong duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the development was finished and the SEO was done, I used
            Filezilla and phpMyAdmin to migrate the website to the client's
            server. After that I went to Google Search Console to ask for a
            crawl of the new version of his website to get his new ranking.
